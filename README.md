# usa_eatery# usa_eatery


usa_eatery was formally known as chicago_eatery.

The initial concept/idea behind it was to create a website strictly dedicated to Chicago restaurants however we weren't able to find an api that was free that offered strictly Chicago

After much debate, we decided to create a website that renders restaurants throughout the US.

Essentially our website utilizes rapidapi and googlemaps api to display restaurants in any state that you are in as well as the location and website to the restaurant. 

We offer a dropdown list that features every single state, and once you select your desired state and hit search it will list the different restaurants in the selected state as well as what city it is in.

It also features a signup & login page where you are able to save restaurants that you are intreged by or thoroughly have enjoyed.

The main home page features our intial idea which was speficially dedicated to Chicago and displays images of food and if you innteract with the image it will take you the website that the food is from.

Our side nav bar expresses everything our website has to offer including a page dedicated to Chicago restaurants!


Overall we thoroughly enjoyed creating this website and plan on adding to it in the future.
